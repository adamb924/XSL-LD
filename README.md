===== XSL Transformations for Language Documentation =====

This is a collection of XSL transformations that I anticipate will be broadly useful for people involved in language documentation. They are tools that have been helpful in my workflow, particularly as I have generated large corpora of interlinear texts.

Each folder contains the XSL file, a README.txt file, and demonstration files. 

The README shows an xsltproc command that will apply the transformation, but I recommend XSLExpress (http://adambaker.org/xslexpress.php) if you're going to be doing XSL transformations routinely.

I expect that this collection will grow over time.
